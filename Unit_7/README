** OVERVIEW **
- This is a simple multi-client chat application built in Java using socket programming. The server manages connections from multiple clients, assigns unique IDs, and broadcasts messages. Each client connects to the server, provides a name, and can send/receive messages in real-time. Features include user names in broadcasts, colored incoming messages (cyan via ANSI codes), prompt clearing for smooth UI, and a "/q" command to quit gracefully.

** REQUIREMENTS **
- Java JDK 8 or higher.
- A Java-compatible IDE like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the Java extension pack installed (optional for debugging)
- No external libraries required; uses standard Java packages (java.net, java.io, java.util).

** COMPILATION **
- 1. Open the project folder in VSCode.
- 2. Compile the source files:
-     javac ChatServer.java
-     javac ChatClient.java

** HOW TO RUN **
- To simulate a multi-client setup as described (server on left 50% of screen, client 1 on top-right 25%, client 2 on bottom-right 25%):
- 1. Open three separate VSCode windows:
-     Window 1 (Server): Position on the left half of the screen (50% width). Navigate to the project folder and run the server:
-       java ChatServer
-       The server will start listening on localhost port 12345 and log connections, messages, and disconnections.
- 2. Window 2 (Client 1): Position on the top-right quarter of the screen (25% width). Navigate to the project folder and run a client:
-     java ChatClient
-     Follow prompts: Enter name, then send messages.
- 3. Window 3 (Client 2): Position on the bottom-right quarter of the screen (25% width). Navigate to the project folder and run another client:
-     java ChatClient
-     Follow prompts: Enter name, then send messages.
 - Messages sent from one client are broadcasted to others with the format: "New message from <name>(ID X): <message>".
 - To quit a client, type "/q" at the message prompt.
 - The server detects disconnections (e.g., via Ctrl+C or "/q") and updates the client list.
 - Note: ANSI color codes and prompt clearing work best in terminals that support them (e.g., VSCode integrated terminal). If issues arise, run in Command Prompt or adjust terminal settings.

** IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS **
- ### Server (ChatServer.java)
 - Uses ServerSocket to listen for connections on port 12345.
 - Each client is handled in a separate thread via an inner ClientHandler class for concurrency.
 - Maintains a thread-safe list of clients using CopyOnWriteArrayList.
 - Assigns sequential unique IDs to clients.
 - Reads the client's name as the first input after connection.
 - Broadcasts messages to all other clients, prefixing with the sender's name and ID.
 - Logs connections/disconnections with name, ID, and total clients.
 - Handles errors and cleanups in try-catch-finally blocks for robustness.
- ### Client (ChatClient.java)
 - Connects to the server using Socket on localhost:12345.
 - Prompts for user name and sends it to the server.
 - Displays a "Hello <name> !" greeting.
 - Uses a daemon thread for receiving messages: Clears the current prompt, prints incoming messages in cyan, and reprints the prompt.
 - Main thread handles user input via Scanner, sending messages to the server.
 - Supports "/q" to quit: Shuts down socket I/O to unblock the receiver thread and exit cleanly.
 - Resource cleanup in a finally block to close streams and socket.
